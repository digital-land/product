A tool for measuring the quality of land and housing data.

## Why we are building this

There are a number of reasons why we believe a data maturity model is something worth building:

* it will increase trust in the data we're making available
* it will help data provides identify where they can make improvements to the quality of their data
* we will be able to measure how the quality of land and housing data is improving over time

### Hypotheses

* we are able to define a model for measuring data quality at a local and national level
* data providers will use the data maturity model to find ways to improve the quality of their data
* users of land and housing data will have an improved level of trust in the data we're making available

## What we've done so far

We've begun exploring potential measures of data quality these include:

* percentage coverage of a national dataset
* the number of patches our data pipeline has to apply in order to build a national dataset
* the license under which data was originally published
* how much of the data we're able to collected from the authoritative source
* the frequency of updates to a dataset
