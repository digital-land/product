A way for data provides to inform us when they've published a new dataset.

## Why we are building this

At the moment when a data provider publishes a new dataset, or changes the URL where the data can be collected from, then the current guidance pages advises them to email Digital Land. When a new email is received we manually add the new resource to the relevant collection.

With the current volume of datasets being published this doesn't provide too much of an overhead. But as the number of datasets that local authorities are asked to publish, and potentially an increased frequency of change this may become problematic.


### Hypotheses

* a more structured way of informing us when new data has been published will allow us to automate adding new resources into a collection 

## What we've done so far

We've configured Jira Service Desk to create a ticket each time an email is sent to the Digital Land email inbox.
