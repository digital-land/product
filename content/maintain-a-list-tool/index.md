A tool for maintaining CSV lists or registers.

## Why we are building this

As of December 2020 we have 6 lists of things that MHCLG maintain with 2 others being worked on. As we learn more about the planning reforms the number of centrally maintained registers is potentially going to increase.

At the moment Digital Land are maintaining (and in some cases defining) those lists. However, we envisage that they’d be maintained at source, i.e. by planning policy.

We'd like to build a tool to help manage these lists. It needs to allow users to:

* add a new item
* end an item
* edit an item whilst maintaining history

### Hypotheses

* colleagues in planning policy will be the custodians of MHCLG registers (i.e. lists of permitted development rights, lists of use classes)
* planning policy colleagues will not be using GitHub to maintain the MHCLG registers
* a tool will help us hide the complexity of the dates for an entity


## What we've done so far

In 2019 we started looking at a [tool to help users edit registers](https://github.com/digital-land/register-editing-tool) however this was experimental and other priorities took over.
